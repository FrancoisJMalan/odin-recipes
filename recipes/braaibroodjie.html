    <h1>Braaibroodjies</h1>

    <p>The best way to explain how important braaibrrodjies are in
        South African and braai culture is to mention that has inspired
        songs and books have been written on it, it has its own memes.
        The best thing about it however is that despite for a few basic
        rules of thumb, you can put whatever you like on it. There are
        enough fillings to fill a recipe book (mentioned above). The
        only limit is you own imagination, fillings can be as diverse
        as mango atchar to mushrooms to mashed banana & peanut butter.
        Below will follow instructions for the original, which is by no
        means the only way to make it. It's more guidelines than actual
        rules.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Loaf of bread (sliced)</li>
        <li>olive oil/vegan butter/butter(vegetarian)</li>
        <li>tomatoes (sliced)</li>
        <li>onions (sliced)</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>vegan cheese/cheese(vegetarian)</li>
        <li><a href = https://www.mrsballs.com target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Mrs Ball's Chutney (Optional)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter the bread on the outsides, or both. This is your
            chance to have your bread buttered on both sides!
        </li>
        <li>Put the fillings in as if making a normal sandwich, don't
            be shy with the salt & pepper.
        </li>
        <li>The chutney is an optional extra, there is no right or
            wrong, it is a matter of personal taste.
        </li>
        <li>Pack the braaibroodjies with the buttered side to the
            outside on a braai grid. (Nothing stops you from putting
            butter on the inside and outside).
        </li>
        <li>Braai over very slow coals quite high above the coals. Most
            foods will make a sound if it gets too hot, braaibroodjies
            don't, just burn pitch black without warning.
            Hence it is important to butter them on the outside
            and turn them around often. There's a saying in Afrikaans:
            <i>"Braaibroodjies is draaibroodjies"</i>. Meaning you have
            to turn them often, but it also rhymes, which is cool.
        </li>
        <li>The braaibrrodjies are ready when the outside is golden
            brown and crispy, but not burnt. By now the cheese should
            be melted and the onions soft, they are ready to be served!
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mielies aka sweetcorn aka corn on the cob</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This is as simple as it gets, you roast them over the coals
            turning them every now and again. The mielie should be
            slightly caramelised in spots but not burnt or dried out,
            it should still taste juicy.
        </li>
        <li>If you can get them with the leaves on e.g. from a farmer's
            market not the shops, you can throw them over the coals
            while still inside their leaves. They will steam themselves
            that way.
        </li>
        <li>You ca serve this as is with just some salt & pepper, or
            melted butter, chermoula sauce, jalapeno's, smoked paprika,
            you can enjoy them in any way your heart desires.
        </li>
